            You get paid as soon as your item ships.  To get your shipping label, go to your orders in your profile. Print the label and take it with you to the post office with some tape and your good to go!

        <h3>How to Ship</h3>
        <p>
            Curtsy provides you with USPS labels for your orders to make shiping simple and easy. Here is how it works:
            <ol>
                <li>Print your shipping label</li>
                <li>Head to the post office with some tape</li>
                <li>Look for the shipping supplies and find the <strong> USPS Priority mail Padded Envelope</strong>. They are free.</li>
                <li>Seal the item in the Padded Envelope and drop it in the mail slot.</li>
            </ol>
            When using a label you don't have to wait in line -- just attach the labels and drop it off at the desk. You can even take some padded envelopes home with you. Then you can pack your item at home and drop it in any USPS blue bin. 
        </p>
        <h3>What if my item doesn't fit?</h3>
