		<h1>We're changing our pricing.</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
        Our members uploaded 80,000 items to Curtsy last year. Renters saved over $1 million renting these items instead of buying them new. 
        <br><br>
        This is incredible — but we're just getting started. 
        <br><br>
        Starting today, we're adjusting our pricing so that we can continue to invest in Curtsy your school, market to new users, and launch new features.
        </p>
        <h1>Here's what's changing</h1><br>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <strong>We lowered all prices by 20-30%.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
        <strong>We removed all fees from Curtsy. </strong>Before today, we charged renters a $3-6 insurance fee on each rental, and charged owners 30%. 
            </li>
            <li>
        <strong>Owners now keep 100% of their earnings.</strong>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Membership</h1><br>
        <p>
        Instead of charging fees on rentals, we’re launching a new membership.
        <br><br>
        You'll need a membership to rent and browse items in the app.
        <br><br>
        <strong>
        You don’t need a membership to upload and rent out your closet as an owner.
        </strong>
        <br><br>
        When owners make more, more people upload their closet, leading to more options for renters — everybody wins. 
        <br><br>
        <strong>Existing users (that's you!) who sign up this week will get two weeks free when they join.</strong>
